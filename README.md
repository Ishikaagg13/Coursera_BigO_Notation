Optimizing Royalty Payment Systems
Lab Goal
In this lab, you will optimize an inefficient O(N^2) royalty payment system to O(N) and analyze the performance improvements.


Lab Description
We have provided code modeling three publishing companies and their algorithms for paying authors royalties:

Company 1: O(1) system

Company 2: O(N) system

Company 3: Inefficient O(N^2) system

Your tasks are to:

Benchmark the existing runtimes

Refactor the O(N^2) implementation to O(N)

Compare the runtimes between original and optimized versions

Plot the Big-O scalability of all three systems

Lab Steps
1. Review the three implementations (see lab code)

2. Benchmark runtimes with 10 and 100 authors
